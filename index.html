				Science in the media always seems to be very one-sided. News media chasing sensations and much has been written about the research, "British scientists" and the low probability, but high-profile discoveries, which may take place in the future, not only paying attention to really important things.

Look At Me 8 selected topics about which most scientists have long come to a consensus, but thanks to all the media for some reason it seems that about them still makes sense to argue.
